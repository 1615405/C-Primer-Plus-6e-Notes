If scanf() runs into a problem before attemping to convert the value(for example, by detecting the end of the file 
or by encountering a handware problem), it returns the special value EOF, which typically is defined as -1.

When using while, keep in mind that only the single statement, simple or compound, following the test condition is 
part of the loop.

For C, a true expression has the value 1, and a false expression has the value 0.

All nonzero values are regarded as true, and only 0 is recognized as false. Alternatively, you can say that a while 
loop executes as long as its test condition evaluates to nonzero. Keep in mind that relational expressions evaluate 
to 1 if true and to 0 if false, so such expressions really are numeric.

Furthermore, the value of an assignment statement is the value of the left side, so status = 1 has the same numerical
value of 1. 

A _Bool variable can only have a value of 1(true) or 0(false). If you try to assign a nonzero numeric value to a 
_Bool variable, the variable is set to 1, reflecting that C considers any nonzero value to be true.

C99 also provides for a stdbool.h header files. This header file makes bool an alias for _Bool and defines true and 
false as symbolic constants for the values 1 and 0. 

The for loop gathers all three actions(initializing, testing, and updating) into one place.

The first expression is the initialization. It is done just once, when the for loop first starts. The second 
expression is the test condition; it is evaluated before each potential execution of a loop. When the expression is
false, the loop is terminated. The third expression, the change or update, is evaluated at the end of each loop.

Each of the three control expressions is a full expression, so any side effects in a control expression, such as 
incrementing a value, take place before the program evaluates another expression.

The comma is a sequence point, so all side effects to the left of the comma take place before the program moves to 
the right of the comma.

The comma being a sequence point guarantees that the side effects of the left subexpression occur before the right 
subexpression is evaluated. the value of the whole comma expression is the value of the right-hand member.
