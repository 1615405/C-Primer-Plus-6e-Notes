Note that gets() discards a newline on input, but puts() adds a newline on output. On the other hand, fgets() stores the
newline on input, and fputs() doesn't add a newline on output. The point is that puts() is designed to work with gets(),
and fputs() is designed to work with fgets().

The ANSI standard says the strcmp() returns a negative number if the first string comes before the second alphabetcially,
returns 0 if they are the same, and returns a positive number if the first string follows the second alphabetcially.

Remember, declaring an array allocates storage space for data; declaring a pointer only allocates storage space for one
address.
