Consider an assignment statement. Its purpose is to store a value at a memory location,. Data object is a general term 
for a region of data storage that can be used to hold values. The C standard uses just the term object for this concept.
One way to identify an object is by using the name of a variable. But, as you will eventually learn, there are other was
to identify an object. For example, you could specify an element of an array, a member of a structure, or use a pointer
expression that involves the address of the object. C use the term lvalue to mean any such name or expression that 
identifies a particular data object. Object refers to the actual data stroage, but an lvalue is a label used to 
identify, or locate, the storage.

And C added the term modifiable lvalue to identify an object whose value can be changed. Therefore, the left side of an
assignment operator should be a modefiable lvalue.

Rvalues can be constants, variables, or any other expression that yields a value, such as a function call.

income = salary + bribes; As a reminder, note the income, salary, and bribes all are modifiable lvalues because each
identifies a data object that could be assigned a value, but the expression salary + bribes is an rvalue, a 
calculated value not identified with a particular memory location.
