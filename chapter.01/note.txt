The basic strategy in C programming is to use programs that converts your source code file to an executable file, 
which is a file containing ready-to-run machine language code. C implementations typically do this in two steps: 
compiling and linking. The compiler converts your source code to an intermediate code, and the linker combines this 
with other code to produce the executable file.

There are several choices for the form of the intermediate files. The most prevalent choice, and the one taken by the 
implementations described here, is to convert the source code to machine language code, placing the result in an object
code file, or object file for short.(This assumes that your source code consists of a single file). Although the object
file contains machine language code, it is not ready to run. The object file contains the translation of your source 
code, but it is not yet a complete program.

The first element missing from the object code file is something called startup code, which is code that acts as an 
interface between your program and the operating system.

The second missing element is the code for library routines. Nearly all C programs make use of routines(called functions) 
that are part of the standard C library.

The role of the linker is to bring together these three elements--your object code, the standard startup code for 
your system, and the library code--and put them together into a single file, the executable file. For library code, 
the linker extracts only the code needed for the functions you use from the library.

In short, an object file and an executable file both consist of machine language instructions. However, the object file 
contains the machine language translation only for the code you used, but the executable file also has machine code for 
the library routines you use and for the startup code.
