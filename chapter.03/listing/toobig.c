/**
 * The unsigned integer j is acting like a car's odometer. when it reaches its maximum value, it starts over at the
 * beginning. The integer i acts similarly. The main difference is that the unsigned int variable j, like an odometer,
 * begins at 0, but the int variable i begins at -2147483648.
 * 
 * Octal and hexadecimal constants are treated as type iny unless the value is too large. Then the compiler tries
 * unsigned int. If that doesn't work, it tries, in order, long, unsigned long, long long, and unsigned long long.
 * 
 * To cause a small constant to be treated as type long, you can append an l or L as a suffix. Similarly, on those
 * systems supporting the long long type, you can use ll or LL suffix to indicate a long long value.
