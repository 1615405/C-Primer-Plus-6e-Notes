/**
 * The %f instructs scanf() to read a floating-point number from the keyboard, and the &weight tells scanf() to read
 * assign the input value to the variable named weight.
 * 
 * Some types of data are preset before a program is used and keep their values unchanged throughout the life of the
 * program. These are constants. Other types of data may change or be assigned values as the program runs; These are
 * variables. The differences between a variable and a constant is that a variable can have its value assigned or
 * changed while the programming, and a constant can't.
 * 
 * The types created with these keywords can be divided into two families on the basic of how they are stored in the
 * computer: integer type and floating-point types.
 * 
 * Floating-point representation involves breaking up a number into a fractional part and an exponent part and storing
 * the parts separately.
