That is, if you don't initialize an array at all, its elements, like uninitialized ordinary variables, get garbage 
values, but if you partially initialize an array, the remaining elements are set to 0.

When you use empty brackets to initialize an array, the compiler counts the number of items in the list and makes the 
array that large.

Name of array is the address of the first element.

The value of a pointer is the address of the object to which it points. Applying the * operator to a pointer yields the 
value stored in the pointed-to object. Adding 1 to the pointer increases its value by the size, in bytes, of the 
pointed-to type.

Therefore, before you use a pointer, it should be assigned a memory location that has already been allocated.

If a function's intent is that it not change the contents of the array, use the keyword const when declaring the formal
parameter in the prototype and in the function definition.

It's valid to assign the address of either constant data or non-constant data to a pointer-to-constant.
Only the address of non-constant data can be assigned to regular pointers. Otherwise, you could use the pointer to 
change data that was supposed to be constant.

Using const in a function parameter definition not only protects data, it also allows the function to work with arrays
that have been declared const.

int zippo[4][2]

Adding 1 to a pointer or address yields a value larger by the size of the refered-to object. In this respect, zippo and 
zippo[0] differ, because zippo offers to an object two ints in size, and zippo[0] refers to an object one int in size.
Therefore, zippo + 1 has a different value from zippo[0] + 1;

Dereferencing a pointer or an address (applying the * operator or else the [] operator with an index) yields the value 
represented by the refered-to object. Because zippo[0] is the address of its first element, (zippo[0][0]), *(zippo[0])
represents the value stored in zippo[0][0], an int value.

Similarly, *zippo represents the value of its first element, zippo[0], but zippo[0] itself is the address of an int.
It's the address &zippo[0][0], so *zippo is &zippo[0][0]. Applying the dereferencing operator to both expressions 
implies that **zippo equals *&zippo[0][0], which reduces to zippo[0][0], an int. In short, zippo is the address of an 
address and must be dereferenced twice to get an ordinary value.

Assigning a const pointer to a non-const pointer is not safe, because you could use the new pointer to alter const data.
But assigning a non-const pointer to a const pointer is okay, provided that you're dealing with just one level of 
indirection.

The compiler converts array notation to pointer notation. This means, for example, that ar[1] will become ar+1. For the
compiler to evaluate this, it needs to know the size object to which ar points.

int sum(int ar[][], int rows);   // faulty daclaration
int sum(int ar[3][4], int rows)  // valid declaration, 3 ignored.

In general, to declare a pointer corresponding to an N-dimensional array, you must supply values for all but the 
leftmost set of brackets.
