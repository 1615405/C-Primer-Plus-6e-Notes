Low-level I/O uses the fundamental I/O services provided by the operating system. Standard high-level I/O uses a 
standard package of C library functions and stdio.h header file definition.

C programs automatically open three files on your behalf. They are termed the standard input, the standard output, and 
the standard error output. The standard input, by default, is the normal input device for your system, usually your 
keyboard. Both the standard output and the standard error output, by default, are the normal output divice for your
system, usually your display screen.

The purpose of the standard error output file is to provide a logically distinct place to send error messages. If, for 
example, you use redirection to send output to a file instead of to the screen, output sent to the standard error output
still goes to the screen.

The file pointer (FILE *fp) is of type pointer-to-FILE. FILE is a derived type defined in stdio.h. The pointer fp 
doesn't point to the actual file. Instead, it points to a data object containing information about the file, including
information about the buffer used for the file's I/O.

The fseek() function enables you to treat a file like an array and move directly to any particular byte in a file opened
by fopen(). Note that fseek() has three arguments and returns an int value. The ftell() function returns the current 
position in a file as a long value.

The first step in using standard I/O is to use fopen() to open a file. (Recall, however, that the stdin, stdout, and 
stderr files are opened automatically.) The fopen() function not only opens a file but sets up a buffer(two buffers for
read-write modes), and it sets up a data structure containing data about the file and about the buffer. Also, fopen() 
returns a pointer to this structure so that other functions know where to find it.

The next step is to call on one of the input functions declared in stdio.h, such as fscanf(), getc(), or fgets(). Calling
any one of these functions causes a chunk of data to be copied from the file to the buffer.

After the data structure and buffer are initialized, the input function reads the requested data from the buffer. As it
does so, the file position indicator is set to point to the character following the last character read. Because all the
input functions from the stdio.h family use the same buffer, a call to any one function resumes the previous call to any
of the functions stopped.

When an input function finds that it read all the characters in the buffer, it requests that the next buffer-sized chunk
of data be copied from the file into the buffer. In this manner, the input functions can read all the file contents up 
to the end of the file. After a function reads the last character of the final buffer's worth of data, it sets the 
end-of-file indicator to true. The next call to an input function then returns EOF.
