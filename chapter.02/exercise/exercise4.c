> Chapter 2 Exercise 4:

>  Write a program that produces the following output:
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
Which nobody can deny!

Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main(): one named
jolly() that prints the "jolly good" message once, and one named deny() that prints
the final line once.
