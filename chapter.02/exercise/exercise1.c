/**
 * C Primer Plus Sixth Edition
 *
 * Chapter 2 Exercise 1: 
 *
 * Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on
 * one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate
 * lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to your first name and last names on one line.
 * The output should look like this (but using your name):
 *
 * Gustav Mahler    <- First print statement
 * Gustav           <- Second print statement
 * Mahler           <- Still the second print statement
 * Gustav Mahler    <- Third and fourth print statements
