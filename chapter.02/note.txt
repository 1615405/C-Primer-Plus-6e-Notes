C programs consist of one or more functions, the basic modules of a C program.

In gengral, C compilers perform some preparatory work on source code before compiling; this is termed preprocessing.

For the most part, header files contain information used by the compiler to build the final executable program. For 
example, they may define constants or indicate the names of functions and how they should be used. But the actual code 
for a function is in a library file of precompiled code, not in a header file. The linker component of the compiler 
takes care of finding the library code you need. In short, header files help guide the compiler in putting your program
together correctly.

In general, all C functions use braces to mark the begining as well as the end of the body of a function. Their presence 
is mandatory.
