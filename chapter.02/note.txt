C programs consist of one or more functions, the basic modules of a C program.

In gengral, C compilers perform some preparatory work on source code before compiling; this is termed preprocessing.

For the most part, header files contain information used by the compiler to build the final executable program. For 
example, they may define constants or indicate the names of functions and how they should be used. But the actual code 
for a function is in a library file of precompiled code, not in a header file. The linker component of the compiler 
takes care of finding the library code you need. In short, header files help guide the compiler in putting your program
together correctly.

In general, all C functions use braces to mark the begining as well as the end of the body of a function. Their presence 
is mandatory.

In C, all variable must be declared before they are used. This means that you have to provide lists of all the variables
you use in a program and that you have to show which data type each variable is.

Note that the assignment statement assigns a value from the right side to the left side.

C uses the terms actual argument and formal argument to distinguish between a specific value sent to a function and a 
variable in the function used to hold the value.

A program consists of a collection of one or more functions, one of which must be called main(). The description of a 
function consists of a header and a body. The function header contains the function name along with information about 
the type of information passed to the function and returned by the function. The body is enclosed by braces and consists
of a series of statements, each terminated by a semicolon.

Remember, all C programs begin execution with main(), mo matter where main() is located in the program files.

The C standard recommends that you provide function prototypes for all functions you use.
